I'm a biologist who woke up one day and thought *Hey! I really enjoy coding for data analysis*. Since then, I started to learn **R coding** as a hobbie, but recently it started to feel a little bit more than that. This new feeling caught me at the middle point of my PhD studies, so I have another two year to finish my thesis and also learn everything I can about data analysis and programming. I want to make this my ***full time job***, at least for the next years.  
That's why I'm here right now. So in this GitPage I'm going to upload every data anlysis I'd be working on.
